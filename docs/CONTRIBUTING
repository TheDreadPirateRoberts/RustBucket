Thank you for showing an interest in this project.

At this point in time, we are not seeking contributors.

This for two reasons:

1. We are at the very early stages of the project, and are just identifying what it will be, and where it will go.
2. At moment, it is going to be extremely experimental, as we learn about Rust and database internals at the same time!

If the project strarts to come into any kind of shape, we will update this file.

Again, thanks for looking.
